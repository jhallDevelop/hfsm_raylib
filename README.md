# C++ Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) Example

This project provides a practical C++ example of a Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) using the raylib library. It demonstrates how AI states can be nested and managed for game characters.

([demo](https://jhalldevelop.github.io/hfsm_raylib))

This project is built upon the [raylib game template](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-game-template).


---

## Features

* A simple **HFSM** implementation (`src/AI/AI_HFSM.cpp`) managing parent and child states.
* **AI States** include:
    * `Wander_State`
    * `Attack_State` (parent state)
        * `Seek_State`
        * `Shoot_State`
        * `Reload_State`
* A basic `Pawn` class that inherits from an `Actor` base class.

## Controls

* **Move Player:** `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites: Setup Raylib

Before you begin, you **must** have the raylib library set up and working correctly.

1.  Clone the [raylib repository](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git).
2.  Follow its instructions to build the library for your target platform.
3.  Ensure you can compile and run one of the standard raylib examples before proceeding.
4.  Update the `Makefile` in this project to point to your local raylib source path.

### 2. Build the Project

This project uses a `Makefile` to simplify compilation. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run one of the following commands.

**Build for Web (HTML5)**

```bash
make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_WEB BUILD_WEB_RESOURCES=TRUE -B -e
```

**Build for Desktop**

```bash
make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP -B -e
```

> **Note:** The `-B` flag forces a complete rebuild of all files, which is useful to ensure a clean build. The `-e` flag allows environment variables to override Makefile variables.

---
## Running the Desktop Build Locally
Just start the .exe or binary from the `src/bin` folder.  

## Running the Web Build Locally

After building for the web, a `.html` file will be created. You can run it locally using a simple web server.

1.  Navigate into the project's root directory.
2.  Run the command:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8080
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and go to ([localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)).
